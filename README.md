## Mapbox GL - An Interactive Mapping Platform for Any & All Geospatial Data

Mapbox provides many tools to build maps into your website or web-based application, including Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox.js. Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox.js are both open source JavaScript libraries you can use to display your Mapbox maps, add interactivity, and customize the map experience in your application. There are some important differences between the two libraries, though, that will impact how you use them to build your apps.

#### Mapbox.js
* No longer in active development
* Supports raster tiles
* Tiles are generated by the server
* Map styles can't be changed in the browser, but map overlays can be styled dynamically

#### Mapbox GL JS
* In active development — we are adding new features, improving existing features, and fixing bugs
* Supports vector tiles
* Maps are rendered client-side by the browser
* Map data and styles can be changed dynamically

### What You’ll Need
* Mapbox account and access token.
* Mapbox GL JS, a Javascript Library.
* Text Editor, Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code, etc. 
* Previously shared index.html file representing skeleton of interactive application in Mapbox. I won’t give you all the answers throughout the tutorial, but this will hopefully serve as a decent basis for working from after the lab if desired.

Previously shared index.html:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gcmillar/mapbox-workshop/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
