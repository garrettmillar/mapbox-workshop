# Mapbox GL - An Interactive Mapping Platform for Geospatial Data
![Image](img/stress_toggle.gif)
Mapbox provides many tools to build maps into your website or web-based application, including Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox.js. Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox.js are both open source JavaScript libraries you can use to display your Mapbox maps, add interactivity, and customize the map experience in your application. There are some important differences between the two libraries, though, that will impact how you use them to build your apps.

### Mapbox.js
* No longer in active development
* Supports raster tiles
* Tiles are generated by the server
* Map styles can't be changed in the browser, but map overlays can be styled dynamically

### Mapbox GL JS
* In active development — new features always being added, improving existing features, and fixing bugs
* Supports vector tiles
* Maps are rendered client-side by the browser
* Map data and styles can be changed dynamically

## What You’ll Need
* Mapbox account and access token.
* Mapbox GL JS, a Javascript Library.
* Text Editor, Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code, etc. 
* Previously shared index.html file representing skeleton of interactive application in Mapbox. I won’t give you all the answers throughout the tutorial, but this will hopefully serve as a decent basis for working from after the lab if desired.

## Learning Goals, Research Topics, & Data Types
### Identified Research Topics
* Solar potential analysis 
* Acoustic impact of vessel noise on natural soundscapes
* Mapping walkability using social media data and GSV imagery.
* Optimization of pest inpection
* 3D modeling
* Geostatistical modeling of dissolved oxygen levels
* Scene semantic knowledge
* Dr. Laura Tateosian's funding

### Data Types of Interest
* Lidar
* High res multispectral satellite data
* Vectors of parking lots and roads
* .wav files (acoustic), AIS vessel tracking data, environmental data
* Coordinates
* Raster
* Point clouds
* Tabular 
* Climate data
* Spatial & temporal varying DO data 

## First Steps
* Create new Github repo
  * Example: mapbox-workshop
* Open terminal/cmd:
  * git clone "https://github.com/<'your_user_name_here'>/mapbox-workshop.git"
  * cd "https://github.com/<'your_user_name_here'>/mapbox-workshop.git"
  * download [index.html](./index.html) into the newly created file directory (e.g., mapbox-workshop)
* Open html content in your text editor of choice
* Now, let's see what it looks like on the web with a double click:
